                retired at the age of 70 although his body and heart were still very young and healthy. <b> He has now

                        <p> - <b> Mr. Butler, you said clean blood vessels are the basis for health. Could you tell me
                            the reason?
                        </b></p>
                        <p> - Very simple. Activities of organs and systems in the body depend on the quality of blood
                            circulation. Blood circulation means supplying oxygen and nutrients to internal organs,
                            collecting
                            carbon dioxide and metabolic products. In our childhood, our teen years, our youth, we move
                            more, our
                            blood vessels are new, elastic, clean - our bodies receive maximum nutrients. As we age, we
                            move less
                            and blood vessels begin to become dirty. This is due to many factors, not only adverse
                            factors (such as
                            smoking, unhealthy eating, poor environment, sedentary lifestyle), but also due to nature
                            (lipid
                            deposition, processes). takes place in all organisms). </p>
                        <p> What does 'dirty' blood vessel mean? Imagine some pipes full of rust. What happened? The
                            water
                            pressure increases, and the water tastes so good. The same thing happens with blood vessels.
                            When
                            cholesterol or other substances build up on blood vessels, the pressure increases ( <b>
                                Impaired blood
                                vessels are the main cause of hypertension! </b> ), the blood contains impurities, the
                            blood
                            circulation is deranged. As a result, changes take place in all organs and systems of the
                            body. Even
                            skin is a system. </p>
                        <p> The body of the elderly. If you are careful and clean your blood vessels, you will have the
                            opportunity to live for at least 20 years without pain in your organs or joint pain, and
                            your body will
                            work smoothly. In other words, cleaning the blood vessels can prolong life and health. This
                            is not just
                            theoretical. I have recommended this method to my patients and I practice it. All who listen
                            to my
                            advice live longer than their peers. </p>

                            It is necessary to clean the blood vessels. This method has been practiced in the US and
                            Europe by
                            people over 35-40 for more than half a century. All patients there know about the need for
                            cleaning
                            blood vessels. I always wonder why our country does not apply this method. </p>

                        <p> - Yes of course. The main symptoms are: </p>
                        <ul class="myList">
                            <li> Migraine headache</li>

                        <p> Whether or not you have one of these symptoms, after 30 years of age, you need to clean your
                            blood
                            vessels at least once every 5 years. By the way, you will be healthy. </p>
                        <p> Blood vessels have the ability to accumulate impurities, especially in the elderly. To
                            preserve, do
                            not eat foods high in cholesterol because it will build up in the blood cells, and increase
                            over time.

                        <p> - The process of cleaning up blood cells previously took me several months. I find medicinal
                            herbs at
                            the market or order them online, after which I choose to drink. Now, I don't need to do this
                            anymore,
                            because my colleagues from the Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases have created a good and
                            cheap remedy
                            to clean blood vessels - it's "Heart Keep". This product helps regulate blood
                            pressure and treat hypertension. This is a great remedy to help me achieve my goal of
                            cleaning blood
                            vessels. </p>

                        <p> Recently, many patients continue to ask me for advice on dialysis. I recommend them this

                            is very effective. </p>

                        <p> - You know, old people like me can't afford expensive medicines. I would not advise such
                            medicine.
                            "Heart Keep" is not expensive.

                            of arterial hypertension.
                        <p> To maintain clean blood vessels, I recommend repeating the treatment
                            every 1-2 years. Especially with older people. It will help you promote health and delay the
                            signs
                            of aging. Clean blood vessels are a guarantee of health. </p>

                                                stay healthy. Although many of my colleagues have left, I am not ill,
                                                even still have sex.

                                            <p> I have treated high blood pressure with this medicine after many years
                                                of suffering. At
                                                that time, I also had diabetes and kidney problems, memory and vision
                                                impairment. I have
                                                done a lot of treatments without results. I decided to try Heart Keep.
                                                That was the first time I ordered medicine online. I must say is very
                                                simple. </p>

                                                say that cleaning the blood vessels is absolutely essential for
                                                everyone. </p>

                                                many years. After treatment, my blood pressure returned to 125/80. I am

                                            <p> Two months ago, I also did a cleaning therapy with Heart Keep. When
                                                I was blocked, I always felt very tired, now I am very energetic. I used
                                                to have a lot of
                                                headaches, now it's over. I slept better. I ordered a few more packages
                                                as a precaution.
                                                Thank you! </p>
